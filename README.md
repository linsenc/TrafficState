# Traffic State Estimation Classification Problem


This project is part of the last chapter of my Ph.D. research, where the goal is to classify historial data into a number of traffic scenarios. Traffic scenarios could be off peak traffic demand scenarios of peak traffic demand scenarios. 

Data are collected from road sensors. For different traffic scenarios, such as different time of days, traffic behave differently. Thus, data from the same time of day (e.g., even peak hours) accross different days (e.g., one month) could be defined as a class. Therefore, when data are collected at different time of days, they form several classes. Therefore, the goal of this problem is to create classification models to tell given a data point, which traffic scenario (i.e., class) should it belong to. This becomes a multi-class classification problem.

Detailed information is included in my thesis, I also include a brief report in this repository.
